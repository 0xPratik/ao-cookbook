# Testnet Info

On February 27, 2024, `ao` Testnet was launched, for developers and early adopters to explore the hyper parallel computer.

## Get onboard

- What is the ao testnet?

The ao testnet is setup to allow users to interact with the ao computer without fees, to test and build towards mainnet.

- How can people get involved? (Do stuff, earn cred!)

The best way to get involved is to build and use the ao computer with the aos console. See `Things to do`, and you can earn Testnet CRED Tokens as you go.

- How to install

Once you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) on your machine, all you need to do is install aos and run it:

```sh
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
```

After installation, we can simply run the command itself to start a new aos process!

```sh
aos
```

- How to join the chat

Use [Blueprints](/guides/aos/blueprints/) `chat` to load the chat client code into your process.

```
.load-blueprint chat
```

Then join the `Getting-Started` room and say `Hi`

```
Join("Getting-Started", "yourName")
Say("Hi")
```

## Things to do

- Build your own tokenized chat room with the Begin tutorial
- Build a bot to play in the ao-effect arena with the bots tutorial
- Pursue quests on the board and earn testnet cred!
