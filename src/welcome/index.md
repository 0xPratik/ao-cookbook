# Welcome to ao

The first decentralized parallel computation machine of its kind.

## What is ao?

ao is a decentralized computer that can run any number of processes in parallel.

### What makes it decentralized?

It is communal: Everyone can use and share this computer -- including you.

Once processes are launched on ao, they can permissionlessly interact with any other process on the network through a shared messaging layer ([Arweave](https://arweave.org)).

### In Layman's Terms?

One way to think of ao is that it is like a decentralized version of the web, but for compute. Everyone can upload their sites (processes), which link together and interact with one another (through messages, rather than hyperlinks).

The result is a sprawling metropolis of interacting and autonomous programs that anyone can access and play with.

**âŠ¹ There is no other computer quite like ao.**

## ao + aos: The rocket and your rocket fuel.

Normally when you are using ao, you will use it through its operating system: `aos`.

aos is an abstraction layer that runs in your processes, making it easier to use the ao computer.

You can think of ao like your new shiny macbook, and aos like macOS running on top of it.

## Specs

If you would like to learn more about the technical specifications of the system, please check out its [spec](https://ao.g8way.io/#/specs) for detailed analysis.

## Next Steps

In the tutorials that follow, we will explore ao and build everything from chatrooms to autonomous, decentralized bots.
